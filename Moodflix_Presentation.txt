MOODFLIX: VOICE-ACTIVATED MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Group Members:
- Student Name 1
- Student Name 2

Supervisor: Dr. [Supervisor Name]

------------------------------------------
SLIDE 2: INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT
------------------------------------------

Problem:
• Most movie recommendation systems rely solely on text input or past viewing history
• Voice-based preferences are underutilized despite being more natural and expressive
• Capturing mood and emotional state is challenging but crucial for personalized recommendations

Importance:
• Voice interfaces are becoming ubiquitous (smart speakers, virtual assistants)
• Emotional context significantly enhances recommendation quality
• Creates a more accessible and natural user experience

------------------------------------------
SLIDE 3: OBJECTIVES
------------------------------------------

Primary Objectives:
• Create a voice-activated movie recommendation system
• Implement advanced sentiment analysis for mood detection
• Develop accurate preference extraction from natural language
• Design an intuitive, responsive user interface
• Integrate with comprehensive movie databases

------------------------------------------
SLIDE 4: PROJECT SCOPE
------------------------------------------

In Scope:
• Voice input processing and transcription
• Natural language preference extraction
• Sentiment analysis for mood detection
• Multi-factor movie recommendations
• Web-based responsive user interface

Out of Scope:
• Mobile app development
• Integration with streaming platforms
• Multi-language support (future enhancement)
• Voice authentication

------------------------------------------
SLIDE 5: METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------

Approach:
• Agile development methodology with iterative improvements
• User-centered design process
• Test-driven development for core algorithms
• Continuous integration workflow

System Architecture:
